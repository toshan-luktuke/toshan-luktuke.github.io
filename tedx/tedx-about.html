  <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. It is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world.

  <h3 class = "headings">What is <i><b style="font-weight:500">TEDx</b></i> ?</h3>
  <p>The TEDx Program is designed to help communities, organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences. At TEDx events, a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos — sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED.

  <p>
    TEDxSomaiyaVidyavihar is an independently organised TED-like event by K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering and K.J. Somaiya Institute of Management Studies and Research. Our vision is to make TEDxSomaiyaVidyavihar a platform where community-driven people can showcase their ideas that will lead to a change in attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.
